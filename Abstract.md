This project focuses on redicting employee resignations using machine learning model. The model analyzes various employee attributes, such as age, 
education level, performance score, employee satisfaction score etc to determine the likelihood of resignation.
Techninques like data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling were applied to prepare the data, and multiple models including Random Forest were tested for accuracy.
The final model provides actionable insights that can help organizations to improve employee retention strategies. 
The project also includes a user-friendly interface system built using Flask and Streamlit for easy interaction with the prediction system.
